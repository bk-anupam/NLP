Sentiment analysis on financial and economic information is highly relevant for businesses for several key reasons, ranging from market insights (gain valuable insights into market trends, investor confidence, and consumer behavior) to risk management (identifying potential reputational risks) to investment decisions (gauging the sentiment of stakeholders, investors, and the general public businesses can assess the potential success of various investment opportunities).\n\nBefore the technicalities of fine-tuning a large language model like Llama 2, we had to find the correct dataset to demonstrate the potentialities of fine-tuning.\n\nParticularly within the realm of finance and economic texts, annotated datasets are notably rare, with many being exclusively reserved for proprietary purposes. To address the issue of insufficient training data, scholars from the Aalto University School\nof Business introduced in 2014 a set of approximately 5000 sentences. This collection aimed to establish human-annotated benchmarks, serving as a standard for evaluating alternative modeling techniques. The involved annotators (16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets) were instructed to assess the sentences solely from the perspective of an investor, evaluating whether the news potentially holds a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price.\n\nThe FinancialPhraseBank dataset is a comprehensive collection that captures the sentiments of financial news headlines from the viewpoint of a retail investor. Comprising two key columns, namely \"Sentiment\" and \"News Headline,\" the dataset effectively classifies sentiments as either negative, neutral, or positive. This structured dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics of sentiment in the domain of financial news. It has been used in various studies and research initiatives, since its inception in the work by Malo, P., Sinha, A., Korhonen, P., Wallenius, J., and Takala, P.  \"Good debt or bad debt: Detecting semantic orientations in economic texts.\", published in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2014.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a first step, we install the specific libraries necessary to make this example work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* accelerate is a distributed training library for PyTorch by HuggingFace.

We configures and initializes a Simple Fine-tuning Trainer (SFTTrainer) for training a large language model using the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, which should save time as it operates on a reduced number of parameters compared to the model's overall size. The PEFT method focuses on refining a limited set of (additional) model parameters, while keeping the majority of the pre-trained LLM parameters fixed. This significantly reduces both computational and storage expenses. Additionally, this strategy addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, which often occurs during the complete fine-tuning of LLMs.\n\nPEFTConfig:\n\nThe peft_config object specifies the parameters for PEFT. Two of these hyperparameters, r and target_modules are empirically shown to affect adaptation quality significantly\n\nThe following are some of the most important parameters:\n\n* lora_alpha: The learning rate for the LoRA update matrices. A higher value of lora_alpha will result in more aggressive updates to the weights. Other values for lora_alpha could be 8, 32, or 64. A higher value of lora_alpha will result in more aggressive updates to the weights, while a lower value will result in more conservative updates.\n* lora_dropout: The dropout probability for the LoRA update matrices. Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out some of the weights during training, which helps to prevent overfitting. Other values for lora_dropout could be 0.0, 0.2, or 0.5. A higher dropout probability will help to prevent overfitting, while a lower dropout probability will allow the model to learn more complex patterns.\n* r: The rank of the LoRA update matrices. r represents the rank of the low rank matrices learned during the finetuning process. As this value is increased, the number of parameters needed to be updated during the low-rank adaptation increases. Intuitively, a lower r may lead to a quicker, less computationally intensive training process, but may affect the quality of the model thus produced. However, increasing r beyond a certain value may not yield any discernible increase in quality of model output.\n* bias: The type of bias to use. The possible values are none, additive, and learned. This specifies if the bias parameters should be trained. The bias parameters are the weights that are added to the output of a layer. The bias parameters can be important for the performance of the model, but they can also be difficult to train.\n* task_type: The type of task that the model is being trained for. The possible values are CAUSAL_LM and MASKED_LM.\n* target_modules: The names of the modules to apply Lora to. When fine-tuning with LoRA, it is possible to target specific modules in the model architecture.Targeting more modules during LoRA adaptation results in increased training time and greater demand for compute resources. Thus, it is a common practice to only target the attention blocks of the transformer. However, recent work as shown in the QLoRA paper by Dettmers et al. suggests that targeting all linear layers results in better adaptation quality\n\n\n\nTrainingArguments:\n\nThe training_arguments object specifies the parameters for training the model. The following are some of the most important parameters:\n\n* output_dir: The directory where the training logs and checkpoints will be saved.\n* num_train_epochs: The number of epochs to train the model for.\n* per_device_train_batch_size: The number of samples in each batch on each device.\n* gradient_accumulation_steps: The number of batches to accumulate gradients before updating the model parameters.\n* optim: The optimizer to use for training the model.\n* save_steps: The number of steps after which to save a checkpoint.\n* logging_steps: The number of steps after which to log the training metrics.\n* learning_rate: The learning rate for the optimizer.\n* weight_decay: The weight decay parameter for the optimizer.\n* fp16: Whether to use 16-bit floating-point precision.\n* bf16: Whether to use BFloat16 precision.\n* max_grad_norm: The maximum gradient norm.\n* max_steps: The maximum number of steps to train the model for.\n* warmup_ratio: The proportion of the training steps to use for warming up the learning rate.\n* group_by_length: Whether to group the training samples by length.\n* lr_scheduler_type: The type of learning rate scheduler to use.\n* report_to: The tools to report the training metrics to.\n* evaluation_strategy: The strategy for evaluating the model during training.\n\nSFTTrainer:\n\nThe SFTTrainer is a custom trainer class from the PEFT library. It is used to train large language models using the PEFT method.\n\nThe SFTTrainer object is initialized with the following arguments:\n\n* model: The model to be trained.\n* train_dataset: The training dataset.\n* eval_dataset: The evaluation dataset.\n* peft_config: The PEFT configuration.\n* dataset_text_field: The name of the text field in the dataset.\n* tokenizer: The tokenizer to use.\n* args: The training arguments.\n* packing: Whether to pack the training samples.\n* max_seq_length: The maximum sequence length.\n\nOnce the SFTTrainer object is initialized, it can be used to train the model by calling the train() method","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"peft_config = LoraConfig(\n    lora_alpha=16,\n    lora_dropout=0.1,\n    r=32,\n    bias=\"none\",\n    task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\",\n    target_modules = target_modules_linear\n)\n\ntraining_arguments = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=\"logs\",\n    num_train_epochs=3,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=1,\n    gradient_accumulation_steps=8, # 4\n    optim=\"paged_adamw_32bit\",\n    save_steps=0,\n    logging_steps=25,\n    learning_rate=2e-4,\n    weight_decay=0.001,\n    fp16=True,\n    bf16=False,\n    max_grad_norm=0.3,\n    max_steps=-1,\n    warmup_ratio=0.03,\n    group_by_length=True,\n    lr_scheduler_type=\"cosine\",\n    report_to=\"tensorboard\",\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\"\n)\n\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model,\n    train_dataset=train_data,\n    eval_dataset=eval_data,\n    peft_config=peft_config,\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    args=training_arguments,\n    packing=False,\n    max_seq_length=1024,\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-21T13:20:57.180434Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-21T13:20:57.180692Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-21T13:21:55.120443Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-21T13:20:57.180670Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-21T13:21:55.119724Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"  0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?ba/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"825b9f8145d5486c93233713ac23d412"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"  0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?ba/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"ebeaa82551244e97891b74acef1d0c28"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following code will train the model using the trainer.train() method and then save the trained model to the trained-model directory.
